# PharmaceuticAI

Drug discovery is a very long and expensive process. The average time from FDA application to approval of drugs is 12 years, and the estimated average cost of taking a new drug from concept to market exceeds $1 billion. Of up to 10,000 compounds tested, only one may end up becoming a drug that reaches the market. 

PharmaceuticAI was developed to help make this process more time/cost effective, via an iterative process that uses multiple models to generate the best inhibitor for a given target protein.
